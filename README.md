## React Native Shopping Cart

- Just learning react native by rebuilding my [shopping-cart](https://github.com/bpetermann/shopping-cart) project
- The purpose of this project is to gain familiarity with React Native development through a small demo application
- There is not too much functionality built in, you can add products to your cart, search for products and sort products by categories
- Since I don't currently have access to an iOS system, I can't say how it will look on these devices

### Getting Started

```
git clone https://github.com/bpetermann/react-native-shopping-cart.git
cd react-native-shopping-cart
npm install
npm start
```

After running the above commands, a QR code will be displayed in the terminal or browser window. For Android devices, you can use the Expo Go app to scan the QR code and open the app. Alternatively, you can use
[Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)

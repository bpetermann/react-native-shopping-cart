## React Native Shopping Cart

- The purpose of this project is to gain familiarity with React Native development through a demo application
- You can like products, add them to your cart, view a single product and so on
- The component structure is implemented according to atomic design principles
- Since I don't currently have access to an iOS system, I can't determine how the app will appear on iOS devices

### Getting Started

```
git clone https://github.com/bpetermann/react-native-shopping-cart.git
cd react-native-shopping-cart
npm install
npm start
```

- Press "a" to open the App in
  [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
- For Android devices scan the QR Code that is displayed in the terminal with the [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client) app
- Type "npm run web" to view in the browser

### Redux

- The app utilizes a Redux store to manage the state of the cart, user and favorites functionality. The Redux store handles the logic and storage for these features, providing a centralized location for accessing and modifying this shared state throughout the application.

### Run Cypress tests

```
npm start web
npm run test
```
### Products 

The product api comes from a [dummy json server](https://github.com/bpetermann/shopping-cart-jsonserver)

### Authentication 

For demonstration purposes only, no backend logic included

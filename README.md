## React Native Shopping Cart

- Just learning react native by rebuilding my [shopping-cart](https://github.com/bpetermann/shopping-cart) project
- The purpose of this project is to gain familiarity with React Native development through a small demo application
- You can like products, add them to your cart, view a single product and so on.
- Since I don't currently have access to an iOS system, I can't determine how the app will appear on iOS devices
- The main focus lies on app development, causing the styling to be less suitable for web

### Getting Started

```
git clone https://github.com/bpetermann/react-native-shopping-cart.git
cd react-native-shopping-cart
npm install
npm start
```

- Press "a" to open the App in
  [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
- For Android devices scan the QR Code that is displayed in the terminal with the [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client) app
- Type "npm run web" to view in the browser
